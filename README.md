# High Gain Differential Probe

This was my attempt at a high gain (2000X) low-noise differential probe, for use in electronics testing.

Be warned that I haven't gotten this working. IIRC the issue was that it would oscillate or saturate. I didn't look into it too thoroughly, it's possible that there is an easy fix.
